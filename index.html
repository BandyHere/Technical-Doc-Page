  <p> 
Young, fair-skinned Scott is a man of ordinary height and physique. In both the comics and the movie, he is consistently shown as having a very short light brown hairstyle and heavy black eyebrows. Scott is depicted as having shaggy hair throughout volumes 1-2 as a result of his phobia of going to the barber following a poor haircut, which Scott thinks was the cause of his split with Envy. He has shorter, less unkempt hair than before in Volumes 3 and later, when Ramona persuades him to let her trim his hair.
  </p>
  <p>
  Scott has a very casual appearance, and he frequently sports denim pants and shoes with his clothes. Scott wears several t-shirts as a result throughout the series. One of his most recognizable outfits is a green shirt with his initials imprinted on it in the middle that he wears in volume 3 and the film's climactic scene. This is also how he appears by default in the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scott is frequently observed wearing a denim jacket with a furry hood anytime he is outside because of the chilly climate in Toronto. Additionally, Scott's right shoulder has the X-Men logo sewed into the jacket, which suggests that he did it himself.

  <p>
    Ramona Victoria "Rammy" Flowers is an American expat who once resided in New York and is currently employed by Amazon.ca in Canada as a "Ninja delivery lady." She is Scott's primary love interest and is 24 years old. She is quite private about her personal life and reserved when talking about her time in New York before moving to Toronto. She can go into subspace and has seven nasty ex-boyfriends who vie for Scott's favor. Scott is inundated with a list of teas in one of Ramona's home cabinets, revealing that she is also an avid tea drinker.
  </p>
  <p>
    She frequently utilizes a large mallet as a weapon when fighting, which she can get from her handbag by using subspace. She regularly switches up her hairstyle and becomes tense whenever Gideon is brought up. Her head starts to glow when she is angry or envious since she has the ability to travel through Subspace owing to the Glow, although she is ignorant of this until Kim Pine points it out in Volume 5. Scott's previous sword, the "Power of Love," now belongs to Ramona.

  Scott Pilgrim's cool gay roommate Wallace Wells is someone he met in college. Despite the fact that Wallace and Scott are only friends and cannot afford two beds, they do occasionally act sexually attracted to one another. Wallace exhorts Scott to develop his relationship with Ramona Flowers to the next level after their landlord gives them notice to go. Later on, he says that even if Scott can't mature, he can't be his roommate since he has signed a contract with his lover Mobile. His persona is based on Bryan Lee O'Malley's former roommate and real-life Beguiling Manager Chris Butcher.
  </p>
  <p>
Wallace is a young man of average height and build (being slightly taller than Scott). He has a short, slightly messy dark hair and narrow eyes. In contrast to his roomate's "slacker" look, Wallace normally appears wearing more formal clothes such as buttoned-up shirts and sweaters. Whenever he's outside in cold weather, Wallace wears a black coat with a scarf.

Knives Chau, a Chinese-Canadian high school student who is 17 years old (18 in Volume 6), calls herself a "Scottaholic" (though she later gets over him). Knives is upbeat when she first starts dating Scott, but after he cheats on her (after first "forgetting" to break up with her), her character completely shifts. He breaks up with Knives when he "grows up" and admits that he had a crush on Ramona, and she adjusts to the breakup. She serves as the series' secondary antagonist.

Despite being a very inconsequential character herself, Julie Powers serves as the social glue that holds the majority of the series' characters together. She is a well-known full-time bitch and a half who routinely arranges parties, presents characters, and introduces them to one other.

Drummer for Stephen Stills and Scott's band Sex Bob-omb is Kimberly "Kim" Pine. Kim counts the band members during performances (or even simply while practicing at home), typically by yelling something to the effect of "We are Sex Bob-omb!! She was Scott's first girlfriend, whom he "rescue" from Simon Lee back in high school. She is currently 23 years old (24 in books 5 and later).
  </p>

  <p>
  When Scott's family relocated to Toronto, the two ended their relationship, and when Kim followed suit, they started Sex Bob-omb with Scott's old bandmate, Stephen Stills. At No-Account Video, Kim works the entire time the series is on.

Sex Bob-lead omb's vocalist, guitarist, and "talent" is Stephen Stills. He attended the University of Toronto with Scott Pilgrim and is 22 years old (23 in Volume 4 and later). While there, he participated in the band Kid Chameleon with Scott, Envy Adams, and other friends. He presently works as a cook at the vegetarian restaurant The Happy Avocado, where he later assists Scott in obtaining employment as a dishwasher. Although he breaks up with Julie in Scott Pilgrim vs. the Universe and had been dating Joseph for some time by Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour, Stephen was in a troubled relationship with Julie Powers, who at one point believes that he and Knives Chau may have a mutual affinity to one another.

In Sex Bob-omb, Stephen, who serves as the band's main vocalist and guitarist, is generally referred to as "the talent" of the group. However, in Volume 4, things shift when Hollie Hawkes, Joseph, and I assist Kim Pine in moving into her new apartment and we discover Joseph has a sizable collection of recording gear. This astounds Stephen, who begs Joseph right once to assist them in recording an album. Joseph accepts, but only because he thinks Stephen is beautiful. The group finally records Volumes 4 and 5 of an album that took several months to complete, but the final output is barely 17 minutes long.

In Volume 6, "young" Neil Nordegraf is introduced to Stacey Pilgrim for the first time as "Neil"; despite the fact that both of them helped Scott fight Matthew Patel and that they were both there at Lisa Miller's goodbye party, they had never met before. The best day of his life has just passed. Neil is also supposed to have a negative relationship with the term "young." In Volume 5, when Ramona called him an asshole, he said, "I'm young, I'll grow out of it," which was the beginning of his dickish attitude. He is the twenty-year-old roommate of Stephen Stills and has a brief romance with Knives Chau (from volume 3 to volume 4). Steph is his sister.
